# Assignments in C# OOP (ITI)

This repository contains a collection of assignments focused on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in C#. These assignments were completed as part of the Information Technology Institute (ITI) training program, showcasing practical implementation of OOP principles and techniques.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following sections:

- **Classes and Objects**: Basic assignments demonstrating the creation and use of classes, objects, constructors, and destructors.
- **Inheritance**: Examples of implementing single, multilevel, and hierarchical inheritance in C#.
- **Polymorphism**: Assignments exploring method overloading, method overriding, and runtime polymorphism using interfaces and abstract classes.
- **Encapsulation and Abstraction**: Projects highlighting the use of access modifiers, properties, and abstraction.
- **Interfaces**: Examples of defining and implementing interfaces for modular and flexible code.
- **Advanced OOP Concepts**: Projects on generic classes, delegates, events, and LINQ integration with OOP.

## Key Features

- **Practical Approach**: Assignments are designed to address real-world scenarios and challenges, enhancing problem-solving skills.
- **Modular Code**: Clear and organized code structure with reusable components and best practices.
- **Detailed Documentation**: Inline comments and documentation to explain code functionality and OOP concepts.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: C#
- **Framework**: .NET Framework / .NET Core
- **Tools**: Visual Studio

## Assignments Overview

Below is a brief overview of some assignments included in this repository:

1. **Zoo Management System**: Demonstrates OOP principles by modeling a zoo with categories like mammals and birds, supporting filtering and sorting operations.
2. **PhoneBook Application**: Implements encapsulation and dictionary-based data management for efficient contact management.
3. **Employee and Company Management**: Focuses on inheritance and delegates to manage employee roles, salaries, and company budgets.
4. **Shape Interface Implementation**: A project using interfaces to define and calculate properties for different geometric shapes like circles and rectangles.
5. **Duration Class**: Demonstrates operator overloading and method overriding to manage and manipulate time durations.
